        <h3>Why I love coding</h3>
        <p>
            Learning how to code is something I'm really passionate about. I love being able to take my own ideas and turn them into something real. The satisfaction of building something from scratch is incredibly rewarding, especially when it's something that can be used by other people. I also enjoy the analytical and logical thinking that coding requires. It's like solving a puzzle, and I find that really engaging. The fact that <a href="#">technology</a> is always changing means that there's always something new to learn, which keeps things interesting. Additionally, the coding community is supportive and collaborative, which creates a sense of belonging and shared purpose.
